Norvar algebra calculator can perform formula operations, realize calculation simplification, and give specific calculation steps. The user enters mathematical formulas using the math symbol buttons on the calculator. The calculator compiles the entered symbols into a mathematical expression similar to normal computer languages, such as (x*y+1)^{2}, for the calculator to interpret. The creators of this calculator implanted free will in the kernel, allowing it to find specific calculation paths on its own. This enables multiple solutions to one problem.

Users can use this calculator to play mathematics, familiarize themselves with mathematical formulas, and master the natural language mathematics.

However, due to free will, this calculator is naturally not aimed at finding the best calculation path. Instead, it's freewheeling like a human being. So users can challenge the calculator to train their math skills.

In a word, helping users master mathematics proficiently is the ultimate goal of this calculator.
